# Haskell WebApp

This repo contains a very simple haskell web app demonstrating that haskell can be used in the real world to build upon the REST principles taught in the course.

There are 2 files:
* `server.hs`
* `client.hs`

`server.hs` contains the code for the haskell server

`client.hs` contains the code for the haskell client

To run each easily load them into ghc.

`ghci src/server.hs` then run `main` to run the server.

Open a new terminal for the client and run `ghci src/client.hs` and then `main`
