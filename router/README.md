# PHP Router

This contains a simple PHP Router.

This is by no means the best way to implement a router but it is one way.

Included are 3 classes:
* Router
* Route
* Method

The method class models each HTTP Method the library supports.

The Route class is used to model a route and is constructed with a Method, URL Regex and function to run.

`index.php` contains example usage.
